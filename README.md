# Applicant Physical Fitness Tracker

Thank you for your help with that multiple choice test. Unfortunately, too many people passed. So now, we need a simple gauge of their physical fitness. 

## Task Overview

We're going to get a dump of all the steps that an applicant has taken over the past year. This data will be provided in the form of a text file, with each line representing a new day. That means the file will have 365 lines, each holding just one integer. We've included a sample file for you called `steps.txt`. This file contains data from one of the interns, so the steps are quite low, but itâ€™s good enough for testing.

Your task is to build software that will eventually be used with all applicant information.

## Requirements

1. **File Input and Reading**: 
   - Create a method named `fileOpener` that accepts a filename to open and reads the data.
   - Each line in the file represents a day and contains an integer (number of steps taken).
   
2. **Calculate Steps**:
   - Create another method named `calculateSteps` that contains a loop to step through each day of the year.
   - Calculate the average number of steps taken for each month (January through December).

3. **Return and Display Results**:
   - The `calculateSteps` method should return a formatted string, with each month's average displayed on a new line.
   - The output should look like this for the included sample file:

Average steps for January: 5246.10 Average steps for February: 4851.86 Average steps for March: 5777.61 Average steps for April: 5802.13 Average steps for May: 4711.55 Average steps for June: 4792.33 Average steps for July: 5638.23 Average steps for August: 5759.65 Average steps for September: 6114.57 Average steps for October: 5411.03 Average steps for November: 4268.80 Average steps for December: 5138.06


4. **Hint**:
- January has 31 days (so lines 1 through 31 are part of January).
- February has 28 days (lines 32 through 60).
- Follow this pattern for the rest of the months until you reach line 365.

## Testing

We will test your code with other step files containing data from the applicants. Please ensure that your program works correctly with the sample file (`steps.txt`) and can handle a full year of step data (365 days).
